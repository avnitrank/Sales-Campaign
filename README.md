# Sales-Campaign
      
## Overview
The Sale Campaign Management System is a Java Spring Boot application designed to efficiently manage sales campaigns and a large product catalog of approximately 100,000 
products. This system dynamically adjusts product prices during sales campaigns and provides APIs for querying product information, price history, and campaign details.
 
## Features 

- Paginated Product Listing API: Fetch product details with pagination and real-time price adjustments during sales.
- Campaign Management API: Create and manage sales campaigns, including defining product-specific discounts.
- Dynamic Price Adjustment: Temporarily adjust product prices during active sales campaigns.
- Query Features:
  1. Retrieve all products with dynamically adjusted prices.
  2. Access the complete pricing history of each product.
  3. Retrieve all campaigns (past, current, and upcoming).

## Technologies Used
- Language & Framework: Java with Spring Boot
- Database: MySQL
